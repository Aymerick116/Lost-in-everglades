# Lost-in-everglades

   Lost in the Everglades is an RPG (Role-Playing-Game) between a player and the computer.

    A group of tourists has been lost in the Everglades and a ranger must rescue them before time runs out.

    The Everglades are represented by a 5x5 matrix. The ranger (R) starts the rescue at the upper-left corner
    of the park, the group of tourists (T) are lost at the lower-right corner. The ranger has 12 gongs of time
    to find and rescue the tourists before they perish.
